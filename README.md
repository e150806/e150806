- 👋 Hi, I’m @e150806
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Marlin, 3d printing, ALL rc vehicles, CAD, CNC, Arduino, Rapberry PI, Coding, and much more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... All the above.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... All the above. Compilling Marlin especially.
- 📫 How to reach me ... thelonelypastafarian@yahoo.com

- Right now, I am so frustrated, I am on the verge of throwing in the towel. Calling it quits on all of it (not the rc cars). I've had nothing but bad luck and misinformation. I keep running into road blocks and dead ends. I'm on my own and I have no friends to help me. YouTube Information never seems to work for me. I need to learn Linux, but I don't like Linux. Without it, I cannot make any advances in 3d printing. Marlin will no longer compile in Windows. The part that makes it so maddening is that I am not tech illiterate. If I don't get help soon, I will have lots of equipment for sale. 3d printers (filament and resin), cnc routers and milling machines.
